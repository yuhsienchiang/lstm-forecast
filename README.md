# LSTM Forecaster

The primary objective of this repository is to provide an implementation of a **stateful LSTM** regression model using **PyTorch**.

During the model development and training phase for the 2024 Green Battery Hackathon, I came across the concept of '**Stateful LSTM**'.
While [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM) offers a easy implementation of stateful LSTM by setting `stateful=True`, as a PyTorch user, I found limited resources, documentation, and implementations related to creating stateful LSTM models.
Consequently, after conducting thorough research, I decided to develop and my own implementation of a stateful LSTM using PyTorch and share the resualt of my work.

## Setup

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine
2. Move to the repository
   ```bash
   cd lstm-forecast
   ```
3. This project is managed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). If Poetry isn't installed on your machine, please run the command bellow to install Poetry

   - Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL)

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

   - Windows (Powershell)

   ```bash
   (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
   ```

   Checkout the [instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) on Poetry's documentation for further information.

4. Install the dependencies
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
5. Train the model by executing `train_runner.py`
   ```bash
   python train_runner.py
   ```

## Dataset

The datasets were data collected and provided by the 2024 Green Battery Hackathon.

- `timestamp`: The time this row was recorded.
- `price`: The electricity spot price for South Australia in $/MWh. Provided by [opennem](https://opennem.org.au/).
- `demand`: The total electricity demand in MW for South Australia for large stable consumers (e.g. factories, mines, etc.) in MW. Provided by the legends at [opennem](https://opennem.org.au/).
- `temp_air`: The air temperature in degrees Celsius in an indicative location in South Australia.
- `pv_power`: The rate of power generated by the simulated solar panel in kW. Provided by [solcast](https://solcast.com/).
- `pv_power_forecast_1h`: A forecast of what the `pv_power` will be in 1 from the `timestamp`. This data is missing for the first 2 years of training data. Provided by [solcast](https://solcast.com/).
- `pv_power_forecast_2h`: A forecast of what the `pv_power` will be in 2 from the `timestamp`. This data is missing for the first 2 years of training data. Provided by [solcast](https://solcast.com/).
- `pv_power_forecast_24h`: A forecast of what the `pv_power` will be in 24 from the `timestamp`. This data is missing for the first 2 years of training data. Provided by [solcast](https://solcast.com/).
- `pv_power_basic`: An estimate of the rate of solar power that is currently being generated across the whole state of South Australia. This data is missing for the first 2 years of training data. Provided by [solcast](https://solcast.com/).
